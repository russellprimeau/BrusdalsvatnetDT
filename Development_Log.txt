2023-12-01 Russell: Chloropleth is the preferred mechanism for shading GIS shapes by value in Folium. Need to find a working demo.

2023-12-01 Russell: Waiting for USV and sonde log data from Joseph. Might be able to use examples from the manual for app development purposes.

2023-12-04 Russell: Interactive should include sliders or data entry for setting the other Mission parameters at each waypoint, instead of always using default values.

2023-12-07 Russell: The st.cache_data() and st.cache_resource() functions are probably the solution to both slow run times and persistence in interactions (for path planning). Because it is function-oriented, will need to restructure functions so that all external data reading/writing is wrapped in functions which return the object https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching

2023-12-10 Russell: Since Delft3D exports to Shapefiles, worth trying to display Shapefiles in Current mode again, as an alternative to geoJSON. If not feasible, conversion from Shape to geoJSON can be scripted.

2023-12-10 Russell: In both Historic data viewers, it would be helpful to add a simple filter option to remove outlying datapoints from series, perhaps by setting a limit on the derivative (i.e. if large % change in value relative to previous value and time difference, then set to NaN). Could be a slider to adjust sensitivity.

2023-12-10 Russell: In Interactive mode, the program doesn't always clear the Mission.csv contents when the file is closed (at least when running directly from PyCharm instead of online, which PyCharm tracks as updates to be pushed in Github). Something to watch out for with st.cache development.

2023-12-11 Andreas: 1) In Historic mode, the option to select which dates (from and to) to plot data from could be added. 

2023-12-11 Andreas: 2) A frontpage which shows selected plots. This could be user defined, but then you need to add a log in screen.

2023-12-11 Russell: To Andreas' #2 suggestion, see https://blog.streamlit.io/streamlit-authenticator-part-1-adding-an-authentication-component-to-your-app/  and/or https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/deploy/authentication-without-sso 

2023-12-11 Russell: The Instantaneous Vertical Profiler chart sets the vertical bounds only on the last series plotted. With multiple dates or parameters, the extents will truncate one of the series.

2023-12-11 Russell: In Interactive mode, it is too easy to move the map displahy away from Brusdalsvatnet with the mouse or scrollbar (since the mouse moves the map while the cursor is over it). It would be helpful to set limits to the map, or have a reset button to restore the original view. More generally, it would be nice to limit the range of sampling points to the lake's surface. This might be easier using an image instead of a Folium map, BUT it still needs to be zoom-able, and clicks still need to be converted to global coordinates, which the map takes care of.
